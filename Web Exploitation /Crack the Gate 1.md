## 🔎 Step 1: Viewing Page Source
After loading the login page, the page source was inspected.

A commented message was discovered:


```html
<!-- ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" -->
<!-- Remove before pushing to production! -->
```

This comment strongly suggested a **developer mistake** and hinted at a hidden authentication bypass.

## 🧪 Step 2: Decoding the Message
The text looked encoded. Using **CyberChef**, the message was decoded with the **ROT13 cipher**.

### Decoded Output
```text
NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"
```

## 🚀 Step 3: Modifying the Request
To exploit this logic flaw, the login request was intercepted using **Caido**.

A custom HTTP header was added to the request:

```http
X-Dev-Access: yes
```

No existing headers were modified — the header was simply added to the POST request.

## ✅ Step 4: Getting the Flag
After resending the modified request, the server accepted the request and returned the **flag** in the response.
