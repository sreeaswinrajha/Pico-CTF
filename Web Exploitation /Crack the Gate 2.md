## Step 2: Now we send the request to the automater and add the header ``` X-Forwarded-For: 0 ```This header is used to forward the client IP address through a proxy.
## ## This step is important for doing brute force in an rate limit server based on ip adress .

## Brute force

### step 1 : Now add a list of IPs in it and make sure there is a gap between the header and the JSON request, which helps the server identify the difference between 
### the header and the JSON request.
